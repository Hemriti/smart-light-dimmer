# 🔆 Smart Light Dimmer Project

This repository presents two dimmer circuit solutions for lighting control:

- ✅ **Automatic light dimmer** based on Arduino and Triac control (main solution)
- ✅ **Manual low-cost dimmer** using a potentiometer (alternative solution)

The project includes:
- 🧪 ISIS (Proteus) schematic simulation
- 💻 Arduino source code for automatic control
- 🛠️ PCB design using ARES (with routing and 3D view)
- 📸 Real hardware testing

## ⚙️ Solution 1: Automatic Light Dimmer (Arduino-Based)

A smart dimmer circuit that automatically adjusts lighting intensity based on Arduino control. This solution is ideal for energy-efficient lighting systems, smart homes, or automatic lighting environments.

### 📌 Key Features:
- Arduino controls dimming via phase angle control
- Triac-based AC load regulation
- Optocoupler isolation for safety
- Designed in ISIS & ARES (Proteus)
- Real prototype tested
